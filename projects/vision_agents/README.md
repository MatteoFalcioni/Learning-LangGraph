# Vision Agents

We will implement in this project an agentic system that summarizes papers, by also creating summary images by using NanoBanana (by Google) and validating the generated images (with retry).

## Installation

Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install the `vision_agents` package.
