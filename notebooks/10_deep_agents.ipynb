    "# Deep Agents & Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will og over two concepts that are very new in LangGraph (at least in december 2025 while I'm writing this): Deep Agents and Middleware. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents, also referred to sometimes as \"agent harnesses\" are a particular kind of agents that can go \"in depth\" into their workflow: we'll see what this actually means in a second. \n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware, on the other hand, is not a LangGraph concepts: it's a term used to refer to all software layers that \"glue together\" different applications, databases or services. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see how LangChain developers translated this idea into some really useful LangGraph implementations. "

    "[This very interesting blog post](https://blog.langchain.com/deep-agents/) from LangChain explains perfectly the architecture of deep agents. I encouracge you to read it, or if you are more of a yt enjoyer, here's the [Deep Agents video by LangChain](https://youtu.be/IVts6ztrkFg?si=o51HELlDVN3YR6Ei).\n",

However, you can find a detailed youtube video from LangChain devs explaining the specific details here: [Rewriting Deep Agents on top of LangChain 1.0](https://youtu.be/AZ6257Ya_70?si=QSw20KdbgUixCb2p).\n",

    "#### 1.1.1 Planning Tool \n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Code uses a Todo list tool, and this is the inspiration for the todo tool that comes by default with a deep agent. You will be amazed of how useful this can be for your agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 Spawning Subagents \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents go deeper on topics. This is largely accomplished by spinning up sub agents that specifically focused on individual tasks, and allowing those sub agents to go deep there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically your agent will be creating subagents and assigning them tasks. After the subagent complete their tasks, they report back to the main agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.3 Virtual File System\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents run for long periods of time and accumulate a lot of context that they need to manage. LangChain equipped Deep Agents with a file system tool, which creates a virtual file system in the agent's state, that the agent can use to write out notes, in order to manage context. \n",
    "\n",
    "These files are not created in your machine, they are just dictionaries in the agent's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.4 System Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know by now how important a prompt is. Deep agents have longer context (like Claude Code) and therefore their prompts can be huge. If we want to write our own instructions, these will be added to the pre-built deep agents system prompt that LangChain devs built."
