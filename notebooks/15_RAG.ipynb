It achieves 66.1 Pass@1 on $\\\\tau^{2}$-Bench and 76.5 on ACEBench, substantially outperforming all baselines. These results affirm its strength in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration across domains.\\n\\n##### General Capabilities\\n\\nKimi-K2-Instruct exhibits strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. It surpasses open-source peers on SimpleQA (31.0%), MMLU (89.5%) and MMLU-Redux (92.7%), and leads all models on instruction benchmarks (IFEval: 89.8%, Multi-Challenge: 54.1%). In math and STEM, it achieves top-tier scores (AIME 2024: 69.6%, GPQA-Diamond: 75.1%), and remains competitive on long-context factuality and retrieval (DROP: 93.5%, MRCR: 55.0%). These results position Kimi-K2-Instruct as a well-rounded and capable generalist across both short- and long-context settings.\\n\\n##### Open-Ended Evaluation\\n\\nOn the LMSYS Arena leaderboard (July 17, 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct ranks as the top-1 open-source model and 5th overall based on over 3,000 user votes. This real-world preference signal\\u2014across diverse, blind prompts\\u2014underscores Kimi-K2\\u2019s strengths in generating high-quality responses on open-ended tasks.\\n\\n### 4.2 Pre-training Evaluations\\n\\n#### 4.2.1 Evaluation Settings\\n\\n##### Benchmarks\\n\\nWe evaluate Kimi-K2-Base across diverse capability areas. For general capabilities, we assess on MMLU *[23]*, MMLU-Pro *[76]*, MMLU-Redux *[17]*, BBH *[67]*, TriviaQA *[34]*, SuperGPQA *[13]*, SimpleQA *[78]*, HellaSwag *[88]*, AGIEval *[89]*, GPQA-Diamond *[61]*, ARC-Challenge *[8]*, and WinoGrande *[62]*. For coding capabilities, we employ EvalPlus *[45]* (averaging HumanEval *[7]*, MBPP *[1]*, HumanEval+, and MBPP+), LiveCodeBench v6 *[31]*, and CRUXEval *[18]*. For mathematical reasoning, we utilize GSM8K *[9]*, GSM8K-Platinum *[74]*, MATH *[24]*, and CMATH *[79]*. For Chinese language capabilities, we evaluate on C-Eval *[29]*, CMMLU *[40]*, and CSimpleQA *[22]*.\\n\\n##### Baselines\\n\\nWe benchmark against leading open-source foundation models: DeepSeek-V3-Base *[10]*, Qwen2.5-72B-Base *[59]* (Note that Qwen3-235B-A22B-Base is not open-sourced, and the largest open-sourced base model in the Qwen series is Qwen2.5-72B-Base), and Llama 4-Maverick *[70]* (Llama 4-Behemoth is also not open-sourced). All models are evaluated under identical configurations to ensure fair comparison.\\n\\n##### Evaluation Configurations\\n\\nWe employ perplexity-based evaluation for MMLU, MMLU-Redux, GPQA-Diamond, HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, C-Eval, and CMMLU. Generation-based evaluation is used for MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA, TriviaQA, BBH, CSimpleQA, MATH, CMATH, GSM8K, GSM8K-Platinum, CRUXEval, LiveCodeBench, and EvalPlus. To mitigate the high variance inherent to GPQA-Diamond, we report the mean score across eight independent runs. All evaluations are conducted using our internal framework derived from LM-Harness-Evaluation *[4]*, ensuring consistent settings across all models.\\n\\n#### 4.2.2 Evaluation Results\\n\\nTable 4 presents a comprehensive comparison of Kimi-K2-Base against leading open-source foundation models across diverse evaluation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Kimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance across the majority of evaluated tasks, establishing it as a leading foundation model in the open-source landscape.\\n\\n##### General Language Understanding\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 English language benchmarks. Notable results include MMLU (87.79%), MMLU-Pro (69.17%), MMLU-Redux (90.17%), SuperGPQA (44.67%), and SimpleQA (35.25%), significantly outperforming all baselines.\\n\\n##### Coding Capabilities\\n\\nOn coding benchmarks, Kimi-K2-Base sets new standards with leading performance across all metrics. It achieves 74.00% on CRUXEval-I-cot, 83.50% on CRUXEval-O-cot, 26.29% on LiveCodeBench v6, and 80.33% on EvalPlus, demonstrating superior code generation and comprehension abilities, particularly in scenarios requiring step-by-step reasoning.\\n\\n##### Mathematical Reasoning\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base exhibits exceptional mathematical capabilities, leading on three out of four benchmarks: MATH (70.22%), GSM8K (92.12%), and GSM8K-Platinum (94.21%). It maintains competitive performance on CMATH (90.26%), narrowly behind DeepSeek-V3-Base (90.53%). These results highlight the model\\u2019s robust mathematical problem-solving abilities across varying difficulty levels.\",\n",

In contrast, the Crescendo strategy led to a general drop in passing rates, indicating stronger adversarial effectiveness.\\n\\nIn addition, complex attack strategies do not always outperform basic prompts. Some originally adversarial prompts may lose their intended meaning after multiple rounds of transformation, rendering the resulting model outputs less meaningful.\\n\\nAutomated Red-teaming Limitations Due to the involvement of human review, the evaluation results inevitably contain a degree of subjectivity. Additionally, certain plugin types involve API misuse or external tool invocation, which are more suitable for evaluating agent models with tool-calling capabilities. In the context of base LLMs, such tests may have limited relevance.\\n\\n## 5 Limitations\\n\\nIn our internal tests, we have identified some limitations in current Kimi K2 models. When dealing with hard reasoning tasks or unclear tool definition, the model may generate excessive tokens, sometimes leading to truncated outputs or incomplete tool calls. Additionally, performance may decline on certain tasks if tool use is unnecessarily enabled. When building complete software projects, the success rate of one-shot prompting is not as good as using K2 under an agentic coding framework. We are working to address these issues in future releases and looking forward to more feedbacks.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusions\\n\\nWe introduced Kimi K2, a 1T-parameter open-weight MoE model built for agentic intelligence. Leveraging the token-efficient MuonClip optimizer and a 15.5T-token high-quality dataset, Kimi K2 achieves stable, scalable pre-training. Post-training combines large-scale synthetic tool-use data with a unified RL framework using both verifiable rewards and self-critic feedbacks. Kimi K2 sets new state-of-the-art on agentic and reasoning benchmarks, establishing itself as the most capable open-weight LLM to date.\\n\\n## 7 Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe would like to acknowledge the valuable support provided by the OpenHands and Multi-SWE-bench teams in evaluating the SWE-bench Verified and Multi-SWE-bench experimental results.\",\n",

Kimi-K2-Instruct excels in multi-turn tool-use benchmarks, general capabilities, and open-ended evaluations, outperforming all baselines in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration. It also shows strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. Kimi-K2-Base demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in general language understanding, coding capabilities, mathematical reasoning, and Chinese language understanding. The models were evaluated using diverse benchmarks and configurations, ensuring fair comparisons. Safety evaluations were conducted using red-teaming techniques, with Kimi K2 showing robust performance against various attack strategies. The document also acknowledges some limitations and areas for future improvement, such as handling hard reasoning tasks and unclear tool definitions. Overall, Kimi K2 is positioned as a leading open-weight model for agentic intelligence.\\\",\\n  \\\"authors\\\": [\\n    \\\"Kimi-K2 Team\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\"\n",

       "### F.1 Core Rubrics\n",
       "\n",
       "- Clarity and Relevance: Assesses the extent to which the response is succinct while fully addressing the user’s intent. The focus is on eliminating unnecessary detail, staying aligned with the central query, and using efficient formats such as brief paragraphs or compact lists. Unless specifically required, long itemizations should be avoided. When a choice is expected, the response should clearly offer a single, well-defined answer.\n",
       "- Conversational Fluency and Engagement: Evaluates the response’s contribution to a natural, flowing dialogue that extends beyond simple question-answering. This includes maintaining coherence, showing appropriate engagement with the topic, offering relevant observations or insights, potentially guiding the conversation constructively when appropriate, using follow-up questions judiciously, handling hypothetical or personal-analogy queries gracefully, and adapting tone effectively to suit the conversational context (e.g., empathetic, formal, casual).\n",
       "- Objective and Grounded Interaction: Assesses the response’s ability to maintain an objective and grounded tone, focusing squarely on the substance of the user’s request. It evaluates the avoidance of both metacommentary (analyzing the query’s structure, topic combination, perceived oddity, or the nature of the interaction itself) and unwarranted flattery or excessive praise directed at the user or their input. Excellent responses interact respectfully but neutrally, prioritizing direct, task-focused assistance over commentary on the conversational dynamics or attempts to curry favor through compliments.\n",
       "\n",
       "### F.2 Prescriptive Rubrics\n",
       "\n",
       "- Initial Praise: Responses must not begin with compliments directed at the user or the question (e.g., “That’s a beautiful question”, “Good question!”).\n",
       "- Explicit Justification: Any sentence or clause that explains why the response is good or how it successfully fulfilled the user’s request. This is different from simply describing the content.\n",
       "\n",
       "### F.3 Limitations\n",
       "\n",
       "One potential side effect of this evaluation framework is that it may favor responses that appear confident and assertive, even in contexts involving ambiguity or subjectivity. This stems from two key constraints in the current rubric:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Avoidance of Self-Qualification: The prescriptive rules prohibit self-assessments, explicit disclaimers, or hedging language (e.g., “this may not be accurate”, “I might be wrong”). While these phrases can reflect epistemic humility, they are often penalized as non-informative or performative.\n",
       "- Preference for Clarity and Singularity: The rubric reward direct, decisive answers when users ask for a recommendation or explanation. In complex or open-ended scenarios, this may disincentivize appropriately cautious or multi-perspective responses.\n",

(3) Reload: Inference engines simultaneously load parameters from the other IPC buffer.\n",

On NVIDIA H800 clusters, concurrent H2D and broadcast saturate the shared PCIe fabric, collapsing the three stages into a sequential procedure (Figure 13b). We therefore adopt a simpler, two-stage scheme (Figure 13c): (1) All devices perform a single, synchronous H2D transfer. (2) The broadcast and reload proceed in parallel.\n",
