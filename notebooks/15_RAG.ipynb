It achieves 66.1 Pass@1 on $\\\\tau^{2}$-Bench and 76.5 on ACEBench, substantially outperforming all baselines. These results affirm its strength in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration across domains.\\n\\n##### General Capabilities\\n\\nKimi-K2-Instruct exhibits strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. It surpasses open-source peers on SimpleQA (31.0%), MMLU (89.5%) and MMLU-Redux (92.7%), and leads all models on instruction benchmarks (IFEval: 89.8%, Multi-Challenge: 54.1%). In math and STEM, it achieves top-tier scores (AIME 2024: 69.6%, GPQA-Diamond: 75.1%), and remains competitive on long-context factuality and retrieval (DROP: 93.5%, MRCR: 55.0%). These results position Kimi-K2-Instruct as a well-rounded and capable generalist across both short- and long-context settings.\\n\\n##### Open-Ended Evaluation\\n\\nOn the LMSYS Arena leaderboard (July 17, 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct ranks as the top-1 open-source model and 5th overall based on over 3,000 user votes. This real-world preference signal\\u2014across diverse, blind prompts\\u2014underscores Kimi-K2\\u2019s strengths in generating high-quality responses on open-ended tasks.\\n\\n### 4.2 Pre-training Evaluations\\n\\n#### 4.2.1 Evaluation Settings\\n\\n##### Benchmarks\\n\\nWe evaluate Kimi-K2-Base across diverse capability areas. For general capabilities, we assess on MMLU *[23]*, MMLU-Pro *[76]*, MMLU-Redux *[17]*, BBH *[67]*, TriviaQA *[34]*, SuperGPQA *[13]*, SimpleQA *[78]*, HellaSwag *[88]*, AGIEval *[89]*, GPQA-Diamond *[61]*, ARC-Challenge *[8]*, and WinoGrande *[62]*. For coding capabilities, we employ EvalPlus *[45]* (averaging HumanEval *[7]*, MBPP *[1]*, HumanEval+, and MBPP+), LiveCodeBench v6 *[31]*, and CRUXEval *[18]*. For mathematical reasoning, we utilize GSM8K *[9]*, GSM8K-Platinum *[74]*, MATH *[24]*, and CMATH *[79]*. For Chinese language capabilities, we evaluate on C-Eval *[29]*, CMMLU *[40]*, and CSimpleQA *[22]*.\\n\\n##### Baselines\\n\\nWe benchmark against leading open-source foundation models: DeepSeek-V3-Base *[10]*, Qwen2.5-72B-Base *[59]* (Note that Qwen3-235B-A22B-Base is not open-sourced, and the largest open-sourced base model in the Qwen series is Qwen2.5-72B-Base), and Llama 4-Maverick *[70]* (Llama 4-Behemoth is also not open-sourced). All models are evaluated under identical configurations to ensure fair comparison.\\n\\n##### Evaluation Configurations\\n\\nWe employ perplexity-based evaluation for MMLU, MMLU-Redux, GPQA-Diamond, HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, C-Eval, and CMMLU. Generation-based evaluation is used for MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA, TriviaQA, BBH, CSimpleQA, MATH, CMATH, GSM8K, GSM8K-Platinum, CRUXEval, LiveCodeBench, and EvalPlus. To mitigate the high variance inherent to GPQA-Diamond, we report the mean score across eight independent runs. All evaluations are conducted using our internal framework derived from LM-Harness-Evaluation *[4]*, ensuring consistent settings across all models.\\n\\n#### 4.2.2 Evaluation Results\\n\\nTable 4 presents a comprehensive comparison of Kimi-K2-Base against leading open-source foundation models across diverse evaluation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Kimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance across the majority of evaluated tasks, establishing it as a leading foundation model in the open-source landscape.\\n\\n##### General Language Understanding\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 English language benchmarks. Notable results include MMLU (87.79%), MMLU-Pro (69.17%), MMLU-Redux (90.17%), SuperGPQA (44.67%), and SimpleQA (35.25%), significantly outperforming all baselines.\\n\\n##### Coding Capabilities\\n\\nOn coding benchmarks, Kimi-K2-Base sets new standards with leading performance across all metrics. It achieves 74.00% on CRUXEval-I-cot, 83.50% on CRUXEval-O-cot, 26.29% on LiveCodeBench v6, and 80.33% on EvalPlus, demonstrating superior code generation and comprehension abilities, particularly in scenarios requiring step-by-step reasoning.\\n\\n##### Mathematical Reasoning\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base exhibits exceptional mathematical capabilities, leading on three out of four benchmarks: MATH (70.22%), GSM8K (92.12%), and GSM8K-Platinum (94.21%). It maintains competitive performance on CMATH (90.26%), narrowly behind DeepSeek-V3-Base (90.53%). These results highlight the model\\u2019s robust mathematical problem-solving abilities across varying difficulty levels.\",\n",

In contrast, the Crescendo strategy led to a general drop in passing rates, indicating stronger adversarial effectiveness.\\n\\nIn addition, complex attack strategies do not always outperform basic prompts. Some originally adversarial prompts may lose their intended meaning after multiple rounds of transformation, rendering the resulting model outputs less meaningful.\\n\\nAutomated Red-teaming Limitations Due to the involvement of human review, the evaluation results inevitably contain a degree of subjectivity. Additionally, certain plugin types involve API misuse or external tool invocation, which are more suitable for evaluating agent models with tool-calling capabilities. In the context of base LLMs, such tests may have limited relevance.\\n\\n## 5 Limitations\\n\\nIn our internal tests, we have identified some limitations in current Kimi K2 models. When dealing with hard reasoning tasks or unclear tool definition, the model may generate excessive tokens, sometimes leading to truncated outputs or incomplete tool calls. Additionally, performance may decline on certain tasks if tool use is unnecessarily enabled. When building complete software projects, the success rate of one-shot prompting is not as good as using K2 under an agentic coding framework. We are working to address these issues in future releases and looking forward to more feedbacks.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusions\\n\\nWe introduced Kimi K2, a 1T-parameter open-weight MoE model built for agentic intelligence. Leveraging the token-efficient MuonClip optimizer and a 15.5T-token high-quality dataset, Kimi K2 achieves stable, scalable pre-training. Post-training combines large-scale synthetic tool-use data with a unified RL framework using both verifiable rewards and self-critic feedbacks. Kimi K2 sets new state-of-the-art on agentic and reasoning benchmarks, establishing itself as the most capable open-weight LLM to date.\\n\\n## 7 Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe would like to acknowledge the valuable support provided by the OpenHands and Multi-SWE-bench teams in evaluating the SWE-bench Verified and Multi-SWE-bench experimental results.\",\n",

Kimi-K2-Instruct excels in multi-turn tool-use benchmarks, general capabilities, and open-ended evaluations, outperforming all baselines in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration. It also shows strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. Kimi-K2-Base demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in general language understanding, coding capabilities, mathematical reasoning, and Chinese language understanding. The models were evaluated using diverse benchmarks and configurations, ensuring fair comparisons. Safety evaluations were conducted using red-teaming techniques, with Kimi K2 showing robust performance against various attack strategies. The document also acknowledges some limitations and areas for future improvement, such as handling hard reasoning tasks and unclear tool definitions. Overall, Kimi K2 is positioned as a leading open-weight model for agentic intelligence.\\\",\\n  \\\"authors\\\": [\\n    \\\"Kimi-K2 Team\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\"\n",

       "We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual — surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints $^{1}$  to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.\n",

       "1 Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) is undergoing a profound paradigm shift towards *Agentic Intelligence* – the capabilities for models to autonomously perceive, plan, reason, and act within complex and dynamic environments. This transition marks a departure from static imitation learning towards models that actively learn through interactions, acquire new skills beyond their training distribution, and adapt behavior through experiences *[63]*. It is believed that this approach allows an AI agent to go beyond the limitation of static human-generated data, and acquire superhuman capabilities through its own exploration and exploitation. Agentic intelligence is thus rapidly emerging as a defining capability for the next generation of foundation models, with wide-ranging implications across tool use, software development, and real-world autonomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Achieving agentic intelligence introduces challenges in both pre-training and post-training. Pre-training must endow models with broad general-purpose priors under constraints of limited high-quality data, elevating token efficiency—learning signal per token—as a critical scaling coefficient. Post-training must transform those priors into actionable behaviors, yet agentic capabilities such as multi-step reasoning, long-term planning, and tool use are rare in natural data and costly to scale. Scalable synthesis of structured, high-quality agentic trajectories, combined with general reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that incorporate preferences and self-critique, are essential to bridge this gap.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this work, we introduce Kimi K2, a 1.04 trillion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM with 32 billion activated parameters, purposefully designed to address the core challenges and push the boundaries of agentic capability. Our contributions span both the pre-training and post-training frontiers:\n",
       "\n",
       "- We present MuonClip, a novel optimizer that integrates the token-efficient Muon algorithm with a stability-enhancing mechanism called QK-Clip. Using MuonClip, we successfully pre-trained Kimi K2 on 15.5 trillion tokens without a single loss spike.\n",
       "- We introduce a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline that systematically generates tool-use demonstrations via simulated and real-world environments. This system constructs diverse tools, agents, tasks, and trajectories to create high-fidelity, verifiably correct agentic interactions at scale.\n",
       "- We design a general reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a self-critique rubric reward mechanism. The model learns not only from externally defined tasks but also from evaluating its own outputs, extending alignment from static into open-ended domains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kimi K2 demonstrates strong performance across a broad spectrum of agentic and frontier benchmarks. It achieves scores of 66.1 on Tau2-bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (en), 65.8 on SWE-bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-bench Multilingual, outperforming most open- and closed-weight baselines under non-thinking evaluation settings, closing the gap with Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet. In coding, mathematics, and broader STEM domains, Kimi K2 achieves 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 27.1 on OJBench, 49.5 on AIME 2025, and 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, further highlighting its capabilities in general tasks. On the LMSYS Arena leaderboard (July 17, 2025), Kimi K2 ranks as the top 1 open-source model and 5th overall based on over 3,000 user votes.\n",

       "## 2 Pre-training\n",
       "\n",
       "The base model of Kimi K2 is a trillion-parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer *[72]* model, pre-trained on 15.5 trillion high-quality tokens. Given the increasingly limited availability of high-quality human data, we posit that token efficiency is emerging as a critical coefficient in the scaling of large language models. To address this, we introduce a suite of pre-training techniques explicitly designed for maximizing token efficiency. Specifically, we employ the token-efficient Muon optimizer *[33, 46]* and mitigate its training instabilities through the introduction of QK-Clip. Additionally, we incorporate synthetic data generation to further squeeze the intelligence out of available high-quality tokens. The model architecture follows an ultra-sparse MoE with multi-head latent attention (MLA) similar to DeepSeek-V3 *[10]* , derived from empirical scaling law analysis. The underlying infrastructure is built to optimize both training efficiency and research efficiency.\n",

Experiments in our previous work Moonlight *[46]* show that, under the same compute budget and model size — and therefore the same amount of training data — Muon substantially outperforms AdamW *[36, 48]*, making it an effective choice for improving token efficiency in large language model training.\n",

Existing mitigation strategies are insufficient. For instance, logit soft-cap *[69]* directly clips the attention logits, but the dot products between queries and keys can still grow excessively before capping is applied. On the other hand, Query-Key Normalization (QK-Norm) *[11, 81]* is not applicable to multi-head latent attention (MLA), because its Key matrices are not fully materialized during inference.\n",

Sparsity is defined as the ratio of the total number of experts to the number of activated experts. Through carefully controlled small-scale experiments, we observe that — under a fixed number of activated parameters (i.e., constant FLOPs) — increasing the total number of experts (i.e., increasing sparsity) consistently lowers both the training and validation loss, thereby enhancing overall model performance (Figure 5). Concretely, under the compute-optimal sparsity scaling law, achieving the same validation loss of 1.5, sparsity 48 reduces FLOPs by  $1.69 \\times$ ,  $1.39 \\times$ , and  $1.15 \\times$  compared to sparsity levels 8, 16, and 32, respectively.

       "Number of Attention Heads DeepSeek-V3 [10] sets the number of attention heads to roughly twice the number of model layers to better utilize memory bandwidth and enhance computational efficiency. However, as the context length increases, doubling the number of attention heads leads to significant inference overhead, reducing efficiency at longer sequence lengths. This becomes a major limitation in agentic applications, where efficient long context processing is essential. For example, with a sequence length of 128k, increasing the number of attention heads from 64 to 128, while keeping the total expert count fixed at 384, leads to an  $83\\%$  increase in inference FLOPs. To evaluate the impact of this design, we conduct controlled experiments comparing configurations where the number of attention heads equals the number of layers against those with double number of heads, under varying training FLOPs. Under iso-token training conditions, we observe that doubling the attention heads yields only modest improvements in validation loss (ranging from  $0.5\\%$  to  $1.2\\%$ ) across different compute budgets (Figure 6). Given that sparsity 48 already offers strong performance, the marginal gains from doubling attention heads do not justify the inference cost. Therefore we choose to 64 attention heads.\n",

       "\n",
       "We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual — surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints $^{1}$  to facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.\n",

       "1 Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) is undergoing a profound paradigm shift towards *Agentic Intelligence* – the capabilities for models to autonomously perceive, plan, reason, and act within complex and dynamic environments. This transition marks a departure from static imitation learning towards models that actively learn through interactions, acquire new skills beyond their training distribution, and adapt behavior through experiences *[63]*. It is believed that this approach allows an AI agent to go beyond the limitation of static human-generated data, and acquire superhuman capabilities through its own exploration and exploitation. Agentic intelligence is thus rapidly emerging as a defining capability for the next generation of foundation models, with wide-ranging implications across tool use, software development, and real-world autonomy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Achieving agentic intelligence introduces challenges in both pre-training and post-training. Pre-training must endow models with broad general-purpose priors under constraints of limited high-quality data, elevating token efficiency—learning signal per token—as a critical scaling coefficient. Post-training must transform those priors into actionable behaviors, yet agentic capabilities such as multi-step reasoning, long-term planning, and tool use are rare in natural data and costly to scale. Scalable synthesis of structured, high-quality agentic trajectories, combined with general reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that incorporate preferences and self-critique, are essential to bridge this gap.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this work, we introduce Kimi K2, a 1.04 trillion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM with 32 billion activated parameters, purposefully designed to address the core challenges and push the boundaries of agentic capability. Our contributions span both the pre-training and post-training frontiers:\n",
       "\n",
       "- We present MuonClip, a novel optimizer that integrates the token-efficient Muon algorithm with a stability-enhancing mechanism called QK-Clip. Using MuonClip, we successfully pre-trained Kimi K2 on 15.5 trillion tokens without a single loss spike.\n",
       "- We introduce a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline that systematically generates tool-use demonstrations via simulated and real-world environments. This system constructs diverse tools, agents, tasks, and trajectories to create high-fidelity, verifiably correct agentic interactions at scale.\n",
       "- We design a general reinforcement learning framework that combines verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a self-critique rubric reward mechanism. The model learns not only from externally defined tasks but also from evaluating its own outputs, extending alignment from static into open-ended domains.\n",

       "Kimi K2 demonstrates strong performance across a broad spectrum of agentic and frontier benchmarks. It achieves scores of 66.1 on Tau2-bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (en), 65.8 on SWE-bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-bench Multilingual, outperforming most open- and closed-weight baselines under non-thinking evaluation settings, closing the gap with Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet. In coding, mathematics, and broader STEM domains, Kimi K2 achieves 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 27.1 on OJBench, 49.5 on AIME 2025, and 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, further highlighting its capabilities in general tasks. On the LMSYS Arena leaderboard (July 17, 2025), Kimi K2 ranks as the top 1 open-source model and 5th overall based on over 3,000 user votes.\n",

       "The base model of Kimi K2 is a trillion-parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer *[72]* model, pre-trained on 15.5 trillion high-quality tokens. Given the increasingly limited availability of high-quality human data, we posit that token efficiency is emerging as a critical coefficient in the scaling of large language models. To address this, we introduce a suite of pre-training techniques explicitly designed for maximizing token efficiency. Specifically, we employ the token-efficient Muon optimizer *[33, 46]* and mitigate its training instabilities through the introduction of QK-Clip. Additionally, we incorporate synthetic data generation to further squeeze the intelligence out of available high-quality tokens. The model architecture follows an ultra-sparse MoE with multi-head latent attention (MLA) similar to DeepSeek-V3 *[10]* , derived from empirical scaling law analysis. The underlying infrastruc"
