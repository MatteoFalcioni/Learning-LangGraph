      "\n",
      "1. **Extract Text from PDFs**: First, you need to extract the text content from your PDF files. You can use libraries like PyMuPDF, pdfminer, or PyPDF2 in Python to read the PDF files and extract the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Split the Text**: Since documents can be lengthy, it's often beneficial to split the extracted text into smaller chunks. This can be done using a text splitter, such as `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which splits the text based on common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is of an appropriate size.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Embed the Text**: Use an embedding model to convert the text chunks into numerical vectors. LangChain provides various embedding models that can be used for this purpose.\n",
