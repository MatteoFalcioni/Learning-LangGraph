It achieves 66.1 Pass@1 on $\\\\tau^{2}$-Bench and 76.5 on ACEBench, substantially outperforming all baselines. These results affirm its strength in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration across domains.\\n\\n##### General Capabilities\\n\\nKimi-K2-Instruct exhibits strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. It surpasses open-source peers on SimpleQA (31.0%), MMLU (89.5%) and MMLU-Redux (92.7%), and leads all models on instruction benchmarks (IFEval: 89.8%, Multi-Challenge: 54.1%). In math and STEM, it achieves top-tier scores (AIME 2024: 69.6%, GPQA-Diamond: 75.1%), and remains competitive on long-context factuality and retrieval (DROP: 93.5%, MRCR: 55.0%). These results position Kimi-K2-Instruct as a well-rounded and capable generalist across both short- and long-context settings.\\n\\n##### Open-Ended Evaluation\\n\\nOn the LMSYS Arena leaderboard (July 17, 2025), Kimi-K2-Instruct ranks as the top-1 open-source model and 5th overall based on over 3,000 user votes. This real-world preference signal\\u2014across diverse, blind prompts\\u2014underscores Kimi-K2\\u2019s strengths in generating high-quality responses on open-ended tasks.\\n\\n### 4.2 Pre-training Evaluations\\n\\n#### 4.2.1 Evaluation Settings\\n\\n##### Benchmarks\\n\\nWe evaluate Kimi-K2-Base across diverse capability areas. For general capabilities, we assess on MMLU *[23]*, MMLU-Pro *[76]*, MMLU-Redux *[17]*, BBH *[67]*, TriviaQA *[34]*, SuperGPQA *[13]*, SimpleQA *[78]*, HellaSwag *[88]*, AGIEval *[89]*, GPQA-Diamond *[61]*, ARC-Challenge *[8]*, and WinoGrande *[62]*. For coding capabilities, we employ EvalPlus *[45]* (averaging HumanEval *[7]*, MBPP *[1]*, HumanEval+, and MBPP+), LiveCodeBench v6 *[31]*, and CRUXEval *[18]*. For mathematical reasoning, we utilize GSM8K *[9]*, GSM8K-Platinum *[74]*, MATH *[24]*, and CMATH *[79]*. For Chinese language capabilities, we evaluate on C-Eval *[29]*, CMMLU *[40]*, and CSimpleQA *[22]*.\\n\\n##### Baselines\\n\\nWe benchmark against leading open-source foundation models: DeepSeek-V3-Base *[10]*, Qwen2.5-72B-Base *[59]* (Note that Qwen3-235B-A22B-Base is not open-sourced, and the largest open-sourced base model in the Qwen series is Qwen2.5-72B-Base), and Llama 4-Maverick *[70]* (Llama 4-Behemoth is also not open-sourced). All models are evaluated under identical configurations to ensure fair comparison.\\n\\n##### Evaluation Configurations\\n\\nWe employ perplexity-based evaluation for MMLU, MMLU-Redux, GPQA-Diamond, HellaSwag, ARC-Challenge, C-Eval, and CMMLU. Generation-based evaluation is used for MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA, TriviaQA, BBH, CSimpleQA, MATH, CMATH, GSM8K, GSM8K-Platinum, CRUXEval, LiveCodeBench, and EvalPlus. To mitigate the high variance inherent to GPQA-Diamond, we report the mean score across eight independent runs. All evaluations are conducted using our internal framework derived from LM-Harness-Evaluation *[4]*, ensuring consistent settings across all models.\\n\\n#### 4.2.2 Evaluation Results\\n\\nTable 4 presents a comprehensive comparison of Kimi-K2-Base against leading open-source foundation models across diverse evaluation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Kimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance across the majority of evaluated tasks, establishing it as a leading foundation model in the open-source landscape.\\n\\n##### General Language Understanding\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 English language benchmarks. Notable results include MMLU (87.79%), MMLU-Pro (69.17%), MMLU-Redux (90.17%), SuperGPQA (44.67%), and SimpleQA (35.25%), significantly outperforming all baselines.\\n\\n##### Coding Capabilities\\n\\nOn coding benchmarks, Kimi-K2-Base sets new standards with leading performance across all metrics. It achieves 74.00% on CRUXEval-I-cot, 83.50% on CRUXEval-O-cot, 26.29% on LiveCodeBench v6, and 80.33% on EvalPlus, demonstrating superior code generation and comprehension abilities, particularly in scenarios requiring step-by-step reasoning.\\n\\n##### Mathematical Reasoning\\n\\nKimi-K2-Base exhibits exceptional mathematical capabilities, leading on three out of four benchmarks: MATH (70.22%), GSM8K (92.12%), and GSM8K-Platinum (94.21%). It maintains competitive performance on CMATH (90.26%), narrowly behind DeepSeek-V3-Base (90.53%). These results highlight the model\\u2019s robust mathematical problem-solving abilities across varying difficulty levels.\",\n",

In contrast, the Crescendo strategy led to a general drop in passing rates, indicating stronger adversarial effectiveness.\\n\\nIn addition, complex attack strategies do not always outperform basic prompts. Some originally adversarial prompts may lose their intended meaning after multiple rounds of transformation, rendering the resulting model outputs less meaningful.\\n\\nAutomated Red-teaming Limitations Due to the involvement of human review, the evaluation results inevitably contain a degree of subjectivity. Additionally, certain plugin types involve API misuse or external tool invocation, which are more suitable for evaluating agent models with tool-calling capabilities. In the context of base LLMs, such tests may have limited relevance.\\n\\n## 5 Limitations\\n\\nIn our internal tests, we have identified some limitations in current Kimi K2 models. When dealing with hard reasoning tasks or unclear tool definition, the model may generate excessive tokens, sometimes leading to truncated outputs or incomplete tool calls. Additionally, performance may decline on certain tasks if tool use is unnecessarily enabled. When building complete software projects, the success rate of one-shot prompting is not as good as using K2 under an agentic coding framework. We are working to address these issues in future releases and looking forward to more feedbacks.\\n\\n## 6 Conclusions\\n\\nWe introduced Kimi K2, a 1T-parameter open-weight MoE model built for agentic intelligence. Leveraging the token-efficient MuonClip optimizer and a 15.5T-token high-quality dataset, Kimi K2 achieves stable, scalable pre-training. Post-training combines large-scale synthetic tool-use data with a unified RL framework using both verifiable rewards and self-critic feedbacks. Kimi K2 sets new state-of-the-art on agentic and reasoning benchmarks, establishing itself as the most capable open-weight LLM to date.\\n\\n## 7 Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe would like to acknowledge the valuable support provided by the OpenHands and Multi-SWE-bench teams in evaluating the SWE-bench Verified and Multi-SWE-bench experimental results.\",\n",

Kimi-K2-Instruct excels in multi-turn tool-use benchmarks, general capabilities, and open-ended evaluations, outperforming all baselines in grounded, controlled, and agent-driven tool orchestration. It also shows strong, balanced performance across general knowledge, math, instruction following, and long-context tasks. Kimi-K2-Base demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in general language understanding, coding capabilities, mathematical reasoning, and Chinese language understanding. The models were evaluated using diverse benchmarks and configurations, ensuring fair comparisons. Safety evaluations were conducted using red-teaming techniques, with Kimi K2 showing robust performance against various attack strategies. The document also acknowledges some limitations and areas for future improvement, such as handling hard reasoning tasks and unclear tool definitions. Overall, Kimi K2 is positioned as a leading open-weight model for agentic intelligence.\\\",\\n  \\\"authors\\\": [\\n    \\\"Kimi-K2 Team\\\"\\n  ]\\n}\"\n",

       "\n",
       "We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual — surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding, mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6, 49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering and agentic tasks.
