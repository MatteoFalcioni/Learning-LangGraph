    "| **Control Level** | **High (Low-level):** Explicit control over every step and transition. | **Low (High-level):** You define goals, the framework manages the flow. | **Medium:** Guided conversations, but agents have significant autonomy. | **High:** Explicit definition of event handlers and steps. |\n",
